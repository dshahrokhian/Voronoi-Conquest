			<b>How to play</b>
			<p>GoT Map Conquest is a game where two players fight to conquer important points. This game is played based on the following rules: <br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Create two players. These will represent the aliases in the game. Additionally, each player can select the house to which he/she belongs to.</li>
					<li>Add points to the map, corresponding to the armies the player wants to send the conquer.</li>
					<li>A player is considered to have conquered a city if that player is closer to that city than the other player. <br/> 	This is because cities are defenseless, thus the player that gets there first conquers it.</li>
					<li>Each player has a limited number of turns, meaning that each player has only a few armies at his/her disposal.</li>
					<li>Placing a point on the map decreases the number of turns.</li>
					<li>The player that has conquered the most cities wins.</li>
				</ul>
